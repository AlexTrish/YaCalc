# $\color{#00db8b}{\large\text{Ya}}$**Calc** - Assistant for Assistants

**YaCalc** is a handy quick calculation extension designed to make your work easier and faster. The extension ensures data confidentiality and takes into account all security measures to ensure no non-disclosure agreements (NDA) are violated.

## üöÄ Description

**YaCalc** is designed to:

- Calculating order totals.
- Generating a finished mini-output that can be copied and used in future work.
- Built-in data protection for privacy purposes.

This extension helps you quickly and securely calculate and generate a quick mini-output without the risk of information leaks.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Precautions

The extension has been designed with all necessary precautions taken to protect data and comply with NDA (non-disclosure agreement) policies, including:

1. **Data processing only on the client**:
   - All data (including JSON) is processed exclusively in the user's browser.
   - No data is sent to a server or other external systems. All data remains within your device.

2. **Data Security**:
   - The extension does not store any personal data of the user. All calculations and operations are performed in the browser memory without saving information to local or remote storage.
   - The extension does not use any third-party libraries that may collect or transmit user's personal data.

3. **No access to personal data**:
   - The extension does not have access to your personal information, except to process what you provide manually (e.g. JSON).
   - The way the extension works: only real-time data processing with the results displayed on the local device.

4. **Confidentiality of JSON responses**:
   - When processing JSON responses (e.g. from an API), all data including order IDs and amounts are processed locally. JSON responses are not transmitted to external servers.
   - If keys in the data are missing or empty, the system will display a message that the data is missing, without disclosing any sensitive or private data.

5. **Manual mini-output generation**:
   - When generating a mini-output (e.g., copying text for later use), only the data that you manually transmit (e.g., a JSON response) can be used to generate the mini-output.
   - No personal data or hidden information from other systems is used without your permission.

6. **Data Encryption**:
   - All data operations are performed in the browser without writing to local or remote databases. The extension does not record or transmit personal data over the internet.
   - For added security and data protection, the extension uses built-in client-side encryption to prevent unauthorized access.

## üîí Why this extension does not violate the NDA

1. **No data storage on the server**: All data that is processed in the extension remains on the user's device. No data is collected, stored or transferred to the server.

2. **Privacy**: All operations, such as cost calculations and JSON response processing, are performed solely within the browser and not through cloud services. This ensures that personal and corporate data does not leave your device.

3. **Data Protection**: The extension ensures that all data is protected from leaks. Extension does not use third-party services or storage that could jeopardize privacy.

4. **Data Minimization**: The extension only works with data that you manually submit through the interface. The extension does not attempt to extract additional data or do anything that compromises privacy.

5. **Automatic Notifications**: If the extension cannot process the data, it will notify the user of an error or missing information. This prevents misinterpretation of the data.

## üéØ Main Functions

- **Processing JSON responses**: Converting and filtering JSON data provided by the user.
- **Calculation of total cost**: Calculates order totals using cost and quantity data.
- **Mini Output Generation**: Generates mini-output in text format that can be copied to the clipboard for later use.
